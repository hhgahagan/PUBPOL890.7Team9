#1
This is wrong because in the second line, my_variable is spelled with a 1 instead of an i (my_var1ble)

#2
library(todyverse)

#Corrected
library(tidyverse)

#ggplot(dTA = mpg) + geom_point(maping = aes(x = displ y = hwy)) + geom_smooth(method = "lm)

#Corrected
View (mpg)
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#3
#We can use help and then keyboard shortcut help, since Option + Shift + K / Alt + Shift + K is the command for shortcuts.

#4
my_bar_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) + geom_bar()
my_scatter_plot <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) + geom_point()
ggsave(filename = "mpg-plot.png", plot = my_bar_plot)

#The graph that saves is the bar plot because the code specifically indicates to save the bar plot.
