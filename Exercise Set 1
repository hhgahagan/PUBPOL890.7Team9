Question 1#R Exercise Set 1

#Exercise 1.2.5

#1
View(penguins)

#There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the penguins dataset

#2
?penguins

#The variable bill_depth_mm describes each penguin's bill depth in millimeters

#3
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point() + labs(x="Bill Length (mm)", y="Bill Depth (mm)")

#According to the scatterplot, there seems to be a positive but weak relationship between bill length and bill depth

#4
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y=species)) + geom_point() + labs(x="Bill Depth (mm)", y="Species")

#A scatterplot of species vs. bill depth puts all the data points of one species on the same line, a better geom would be a boxplot (code below)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=bill_depth_mm)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x="Species", y="Bill Depth (mm)")

#5
ggplot(data=penguins) + geom_point()

#This code would give an error message because the variables on the x-axis and y-axis have not yet been specified. To fix this, the code needs to list the variables that are being related to one another (code example below)

ggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()
