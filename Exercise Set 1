#R Exercise Set 1

#Exercise 1.2.5

#1
View(penguins)

#There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the penguins dataset

#2
?penguins

#The variable bill_depth_mm describes each penguin's bill depth in millimeters

#3
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point() + labs(x="Bill Length (mm)", y="Bill Depth (mm)")

#According to the scatterplot, there seems to be a positive but weak relationship between bill length and bill depth

#4
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_depth_mm, y=species)) + geom_point() + labs(x="Bill Depth (mm)", y="Species")

#A scatterplot of species vs. bill depth puts all the data points of one species on the same line, a better geom would be a boxplot (code below)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x=species, y=bill_depth_mm)) + geom_boxplot() + labs(x="Species", y="Bill Depth (mm)")

#5
ggplot(data=penguins) + geom_point()

#This code would give an error message because the variables on the x-axis and y-axis have not yet been specified. To fix this, the code needs to list the variables that are being related to one another (code example below)

ggplot(data=penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm)) + geom_point()

#6
#This argument removes the missing values. The default of this is false and
#doesn't remove the missing.

ggplot(data=penguins,
       aes(x=species,y=bill_length_mm))+
  geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)

#7
ggplot(data=penguins,
       aes(x=species,y=bill_length_mm))+
  geom_point(na.rm=TRUE) +
  labs(caption = "Data come from the palmerpenguins package")

#8
#It should be mapped to the geom_level because the global level gives a warning.
ggplot(data=penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                     y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(aes(colour = bill_depth_mm),
             na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(na.rm = TRUE)

#9
#The Chart will show flipper length on x-axis and y-axis. The dots will be
#the color of the islands.

#10
#These graphs will be the same because the aes() function can work with the 
#geom() function. The second is the same code but with the information within the functions
