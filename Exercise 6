#3. If the facet variable is not specified, then the text is just drawn in all facets. 
#To draw the label in only one facet, you need to add a column to the label data frame with the value of the variable(s) facetting.
#To put a different label in each facet, you would need to include a variable in your dataset that corresponds to the labels you want to display. Then, you can use that variable in the aes() function within geom_text(). 
#4.
#label.padding is the padding around label
#label.r is the amount of rounding in the corners
#label.size is the size of label border
#5. 
#The four arguments are (from the help for arrow()):
#angle decides the angle of arrow head
#length is for the length of the arrow head
#ends ends the line and then draw arrow head
#type: "open" or "close" commands whether the arrow head is a closed or open triangle
